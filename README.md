# WeatherApp_using_zipcode_and_date

This is a weatherapp project where the input parameters are zipcode and date. This is only the backend code and can be tested over Postman.
Make sure to update application.com and service class with actual weather api key for this to work.


Note - a newly generated weather api key takes 2-3 hour to be active.
